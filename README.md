## CI

I originaly used the commnuity package listing builder https://github.com/vrchat-community/package-list-action

This was missing a few features for deprecated package id, or to refer to other vpm repositories.

Was before using my own version at https://github.com/Spokeek/package-list-action/tree/main to handle depreacted package ids.

But now those features are waiting for aproval so i'm refering to @anatawa12 version at https://github.com/anatawa12/package-list-action/tree/pick-packages
